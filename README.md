Tux-FreeHost Panel
==================

There is no *complete* documentation yet. However,
you can [follow](https://twitter.com/tuxfreehost) the project on twitter,
read [the blog](http://tux-fh.net/posts.html), post in
[the forum](http://forum.tux-fh.net), or come chat with us on #TuxFH @ Freenode.

Installation
--------------------
You can use the installation/management [scripts](https://gist.github.com/Edelwin/7857978) which uses python3, or the
[python2 one](https://gist.github.com/NyanKiyoshi/9028494)

If you just want to launch the panel, you (really) should activate the virtual environment and type : 
```bash
bin/pserve development.ini
```
(it implies that you have satisfied all the dependencies)
